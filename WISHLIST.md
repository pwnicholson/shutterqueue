# ShutterQueue Wishlist / Roadmap

## Next

* [x] Fix preview full-screen display sizing (fit to window)
* [x] Fix scheduler starter dialog to offer "now, wait, or cancel" options.
* [x] Store API keys in a more secure fashion
* \[ ] Fix group limit due to pagination of group lists
* \[ ] Improve location for "start" and "stop" buttons to make it more obvious
* \[ ] Fix text highlighting when shift-clicking on multiple items in the queue
* \[ ] Fix queue tab loading time (lazy load images/thumbnails?)


## Soon

* \[ ] Improve progress bar on uploads
* \[ ] Click and drag to move item priority for the group add list
* \[ ] Group lists: filterable (type text to filter to groups that have a string in their name)
* \[ ] Group lists: sort selected/waiting groups alphabetically at top, then remaining groups alphabetically
* \[ ] Minimize to System Tray on Windows and the status Menu/Bar on Mac
* \[ ] Capture random error codes from Flickr API and display them in the log (probably display all API responses, even non-error ones)

## Nice-to-have

* \[ ] Allow photos to be scheduled for a specific time, not just an interval and queue order
* \[ ] Add geographic data after upload (country/region/city lookup; optional map pick)
* \[ ] Saved “Sets” of groups/albums (user-defined)
* \[ ] Spellcheck for title/description/tags (free/open-source)
* \[ ] Pull in basic info about groups (size, etc)
* \[ ] Per-group throttling (freq + quantity), link to group rules
