# ShutterQueue Wishlist / Roadmap

## Next

* \[ ] Cached thumbnails so that thumbs are still displayed for items waiting to be added to groups, even if the original file has been deleted after uploading. (alternate: download the thumbnail via API, since image has already been uploaded)
* \[ ] Add thumbnails to the group list in the scheduler tab
* \[ ] Thumbnail click → large preview (lightbox / full-window preview; ESC to close)
* \[ ] Fix scheduler starter dialog to offer "now, wait, or cancel" options.

## Soon

* \[ ] Click and drag to move item priority for the group add list
* \[ ] Group lists: sort selected/waiting groups alphabetically at top, then remaining groups alphabetically
* \[ ] Fix “frosted” look on scroll (make panel backgrounds opaque)

## Nice-to-have

* \[ ] Add geographic data after upload (country/region/city lookup; optional map pick)
* \[ ] Saved “Sets” of groups/albums (user-defined)
* \[ ] Spellcheck for title/description/tags (free/open-source)
* \[ ] Pull in basic info about groups (size, etc)
* \[ ] Per-group throttling (freq + quantity), link to group rules
