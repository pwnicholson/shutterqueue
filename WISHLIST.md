# ShutterQueue Wishlist / Roadmap

## Next

* \[ ] Correct \&amp; strings in group and album names
* \[ ] Fix “frosted” look on scroll (make panel backgrounds opaque)

## Soon

* \[ ] Thumbnail click → large preview (lightbox / full-window preview; ESC to close)
* \[ ] Upload N photos per run (already planned)
* \[ ] Group lists: sort selected/waiting groups alphabetically at top, then remaining groups alphabetically
* \[ ] Per-group throttling (freq + quantity), link to group rules

## Nice-to-have

* \[ ] Add geographic data after upload (country/region/city lookup; optional map pick)
* \[ ] Saved “Sets” of groups/albums (user-defined)
* \[ ] Spellcheck for title/description/tags (free/open-source)
* \[ ] Pull in basic info about groups (size, etc)
