# ShutterQueue Wishlist / Roadmap

## Must-have (next)
- [ ] Multi-select: common/mixed values behavior for Title/Description/Tags
- [ ] Batch tag editing: add/remove semantics (chips)
- [ ] Fix “frosted” look on scroll (make panel backgrounds opaque)

## Soon
- [ ] Thumbnail click → large preview (lightbox / full-window preview; ESC to close)
- [ ] Group queue tab: items waiting for group adds (by photo + by group)
- [ ] Per-group throttling (freq + quantity), link to group rules

## Nice-to-have
- [ ] Saved “Sets” of groups/albums (user-defined)
- [ ] Spellcheck for title/description/tags (free/open-source)
- [ ] Upload N photos per run (already planned)
