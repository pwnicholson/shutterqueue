* [x] Store API keys in a more secure fashion
* [X] Fix text highlighting when shift-clicking on multiple items in the queue
* [X] Improve location for "start" and "stop" buttons to make it more obvious
* [X] Improve UI/UX around indicators in the top right corner
* [X] Group lists: filterable (type text to filter to groups that have a string in their name)

* \[ ] Verify status Menu Bar on Mac

## Soon

* \[ ] Click and drag to move item priority for the group add list
* \[ ] Improve progress bar on uploads (just flashes now, doesn't show actual progress of the individual item or the batch it is in)
* \[ ] Allow photos to be scheduled for a specific time, not just an interval and queue order
* \[ ] Saved “Sets” of groups/albums (user-defined)

## Nice-to-have

* \[ ] Add geographic data after upload (country/region/city lookup; optional map pick)
* \[ ] Spellcheck for title/description/tags (free/open-source)
* \[ ] Pull in basic info about groups (size, etc)
* \[ ] Per-group throttling (freq + quantity), link to group rules
