# ShutterQueue — A paced uploader for Flickr (Electron MVP v0.6b)

## Setup Process
1. ✅ Go to Flickr's Developer Page (usually https://www.flickr.com/services/ ) and click "Get an API key"
   - Choose "Non-commercial" for your key type
   - Name the app whatever you like (I suggest something like "ShutterQueue - [your user name]"
   - Read and acknowledge the Flickr terms (and seriously, don't use this tool to abuse the API!)
3. ✅ Copy the API Key into the ShutterQueue setup tab
4. ✅ Copy the Secret Key into the ShutterQueue 'setup' tab
5. ✅ Click "Save", then click "Start Authorization."
6. ✅ **This will open a browser window to Flickr's OAuth page**
   - If you aren't already logged into Flickr, you'll need to log in to your account. This will NOT give ShutterQueue your account information.
8. ✅ Click the "Ok I'll Authorize It" button
   - This should return you to the ShutterQueue app and you should now be logged in!


## Licenses
The app includes a **View Third-Party Licenses** button in the Setup tab.
