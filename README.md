# ShutterQueue — A paced uploader for Flickr (v0.7.7d)

Releases can be downloaded on our Release page
https://github.com/pwnicholson/shutterqueue/releases

Note that this is purely vibe-coded using a combination of different AI tools. I am very open to suggestions, feedback, and help optimizing the tool or adding features.


## Setup Process



First, install the app!



1. ✅ Go to Flickr's Developer Page (usually https://www.flickr.com/services/ ) and click "Get an API key"

   * Choose "Non-commercial" for your key type
   * Name the app whatever you like (I suggest something like "ShutterQueue - \[your user name]"
   * Read and acknowledge the Flickr terms (and seriously, don't use this tool to abuse the API!)

2. ✅ Copy the API Key into the ShutterQueue setup tab
3. ✅ Copy the Secret Key into the ShutterQueue 'setup' tab
4. ✅ Click "Save", then click "Start Authorization."
5. ✅ **This will open a browser window to Flickr's OAuth page**

   * If you aren't already logged into Flickr, you'll need to log in to your account. This will NOT give ShutterQueue your account information.

6. ✅ Click the "Ok I'll Authorize It" button

   * This should return you to the ShutterQueue app and you should now be logged in!



## Licenses

The app includes a **View Third-Party Licenses** button in the Setup tab.
